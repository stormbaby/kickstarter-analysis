# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
---

Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.

## Theater Outcomes using Launch Dates

Using excel I organized the theater outcomes and time of launch using pivot tables in excel. See image below.

The data above shows that there were successful outcomes for all launch dates. I then created a line graph to show the trend.

The blue line, successful outcomes is higher for every launch month.  The failures line shows that there were less failures across the board.  The last line, canceled outcomes, is very few and even zero at times.

## Theater Outcomes using Goals

Using excel I organized the theater outcomes and goals using pivot tables in excel. See image below.

The data above shows that there were successful outcomes for modest goals, up to 20,000. The percentages show that there were more than failed. Above that, the number of total outcome began to decrease along with the number of successful outcomes as a percentage.  I then created a line graph to show the trend.

## Results

*What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
   - The success of a theater's outcome overall didn't depend on the month of the launch.
   - Very few of the theater's outcomes failed.  

*What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
   - If the goal was less than 20,000 there was reasonable propability of success.

*What are some limitations of this dataset?
   - The Launch date used didn't include the year.
   - The data didn't show what the words successful and failed meant.  That data could have been broken up more to see gradients.

*What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
