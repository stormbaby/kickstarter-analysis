# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends


Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.

Using excel I organized the data using pivot tables in excel.
