# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
---

Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.

##Using excel I organized the theater data and outcomes using pivot tables in excel. See image below.

This data shows that there were successful outcomes for all launch dates. I then created a line graph to show the trend.
