# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
---

Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.

### Theater Outcomes using Launch Dates

Using excel I organized the theater outcomes and time of launch using pivot tables in excel. See image below.

The data above shows that there were successful outcomes for all launch dates. I then created a line graph to show the trend.

The blue line, successful outcomes is higher for every launch month.  The failures line shows that there were less failures across the board.  The last line, canceled outcomes, is very few and even zero at times.
